# My Machine Learning and Data Science pet projects

1. We have a dataset with emotions of people after some events. Is it possible to use neural networks to predict the emotions of people for the next event?
Find the answer in the file Emotions2.ipynb. (project 2018)

2. Bike sharing challenge. We have a lot of data from bike sharing stations. How to use it to predict the future net rate for bikes for each station?
Is ML solution is the best or not? Find the answer in the file Vorontsova_solution.ipynb (project 2020)
